<div>
    <p>This Legend of Zelda NES remake was made with Unity and C#. Along with all features of the original temple replicated, this game
         introduces the mechanic of dashing, inspired by Hyper Light Drifter. In this project, I primarily specialized in weapons, UI, and level interaction such 
         as movable blocks, room transitions, and the old man room.

        <p>Shroom Doom with Unity and C#. Shroom Doom is a puzzle platformer where the player plays as a small mushroom guy who 
            has the ability to infect NPC characters around them and control their movements. 
            This game was completely created by myself,
            including most character art.
