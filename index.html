    <p>This Legend of Zelda NES remake was made with Unity and C#. Along with all features of the original temple replicated, this game
         introduces the mechanic of dashing, inspired by Hyper Light Drifter. In this project, I primarily specialized in weapons, UI, and level interaction such 
         as movable blocks, room transitions, and the old man room.
