                                 as movable blocks, room transitions, and the old man room.

                                This game was completely created by myself,
                                including most character art.

                            <p> Over the course of 3 months, I worked in a 19 person studio to create the prototype of what would eventually go on to become Subtension. I primarily
                                focused on audio creation and implementation using Wwise and Unity.

                            <p> Metallurgy was created with Unity and C# on a team of 5 developers throughout a 6 week process. 
                                Metallurgy is a rogue-like action platformer where a player must reach the top of a tower using a pair of upgradable wings.
                                Among other systems, Metallurgy features procedural world generation, an upgrade tree system, and a unique weather mechanic to augment movement.
                                Throughout the process I primarily worked on art and implementation, various dialogue and cutscenes, and the upgrade system.

                            <p> This CSE Simulator was created with Unreal Engine 5 on the VR platform throughout a 3 week process. 
                                It is a recreation of the CAEN lab on the first floor of the Bob and Betty Beyster building on UofM-Ann Arbor's North Campus.
                                Within the lab, players can interact with various objects, including functional lightswitches, firealarms, whiteboards, etc.
                                This project also implements the custom feature of a "take a break" button which transports the player to a tropicaal vacation and back when pressed.
                                Throughout the process, I worked a lot with blueprint class inheritance, events, and materials.
